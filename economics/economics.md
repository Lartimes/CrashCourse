# 什么是经济学？

​	

```
well it might be easier to terem it what economics isn't is.
```

​	 什么不是经济学！
​		

```
经济学不是研究金钱和财富的科学，尽管理解经济学可以帮助你
经济学研究的不是股票市场，真的不是
经济学并不是主要关于打领带穿西装的人预测市场或整体经济将会发生什么。 事实上，只有少数经济学家做这个，但这并是不经济学关注的主要焦点
```

​	**Ecnonomics is the study of people and choices.**	
​	The famous economist Alfred Marshall defined econimics as 
​    "A study of man (and woman) in the ordinary business of  life.It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it.Thus, it is on the one side the study of wealth and on the other and more important side a study of man (And woman)"

成本 
  经济学家把这个叫做 机会成本 （Opportunity cost）

整个经济学最重要的两个假设：

1. ​	资源稀缺  the idea of scarcity 

   ​	人们拥有无穷欲望但是资源有限

2. 每一件事情都有成本

   **我们需要分析决策从有限的资源中受益，这就是经济学**



美国总统 德怀特： 1953

​	

```
Every gun that is made,every warship launched, every rocket fired signfies,in the  final sense,a theef from those who hunger and are not fed,those who are cold and are not clothed.This world in arms is not spending money alone.It is spending the sweat of its laborers,the genius of its scientists,the hopes of it children.
```

重要的是找到激励的措施

```
Sometimes a theory is flawed ，but many times a policy is flawed. 
Economists adjust policies based on theories supproted by data and understanding of incentives.
Having the right incentive is key.
But the right incentives can be hard to figure out.
